They wanted to represent these notions in their restaurant identity and wanted something that could stick and stay long as a brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our initial discussion with them led us to understand where they came up with their original name and identity 'Rollers and Toasters' which was very literal in describing the food they served and the fun take on roller coasters was, we thought, an unnecessary element that led to confusion amongst customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Blessed Bites. Made Fresh.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a great time coming up with the name 'Blessed Bites' and the tagline 'Made Fresh' in this rebranding exercise. It fit seemlessly with the owners' ethos. We used the tricolour saffron and green colours in the logo that represented their love for the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;padded&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blessed-bites/small/blessed-bites-logo-halfday-works.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;/assets/img/blessed-bites/blessed-bites-logo-halfday-works.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;blessed-bites-logo-halfday-works&quot; class=&quot;showimage lazyload blur-up&quot; /&gt;

	&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clean menu card was designed using the branding to make it even more purposeful. The couple insisted on having their own identities also be incorporated in the design and so their sketches were created and added to the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Clean lines. Clear products.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;padded&quot;&gt;

	&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental graphics were also created utilising branding to give the restaurant a clean and hygenic look and feel. The photographs used in the designs are of very high resolution giving crisp prints that display the products clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Lovable and distinctive. Shirku's great.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The character is a young child in his sleeping pyjamas that are designed like a magician's robe along with his star studded magician's hat. He is in his favourite boots. And has his powerful beginner's magic wand. There are only 6 moving parts in total which reduces the animator's load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The face is gently smiling and can move from the neck to see upwards and downwards. There are only 3 expressions which are animated to conditions in gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

Initially, the new venture was to be named Kaustubh Super Bazaar - with &quot;Kaustubh&quot; being the name of one of their family members. But after surveys and discussions, it was finalised to be Kaustubh Mart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to respect their feelings behind the name. So we took the liberty to research into the name and found out its mythological significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Mystic. Lotus Inspired.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaustubh is the name given to a ratna (gem) that emerged from the mythological tale of Samudramanthan which is adorned by Lord Vishnu. Even so, there is no description of this ratna and since it emerged from the eternal sea, some intellectuals depict it as the lotus that Vishnu always holds in his hand and so we took this as an opportunity to make the logo lotus inspired. Coincedentally, K also stands for Kamal - which literally means lotus in Sanskrit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this perfect spot is located on a street out of the market and with lesser footfall. As a resultant, they realised a drop in their walk-ins while their online and delivery orders had remained stable.The plush comfortable place needed a playful inviting buzz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Playful. Inviting. Comfortable.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
