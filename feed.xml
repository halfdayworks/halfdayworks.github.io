It is a premier dairy and traditional Indian sweets producer serving locals since 1999. It aspires to become a brand now and is preparing itself for a larger market. And so, they wanted to update their identity to recent times and wanted a logo that makes them unique and recognisable, that is proud of its heritage and keep to its roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;English and Marathi.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We designed a logo with both english and marathi languages that aligned with the state regulations and also helped in marketing focusing on local population which is largely marathi-speaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With their aim to become a brand, they wanted to explore packaging designs for their dairy products that stood out in a highly competetive business. Along with it, updating their sweet box designs became a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Fresh. Clean. Distintive.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the entreprenuer client had a few guidelines for us, we were given the liberty to be our creative self. Initially, the new venture was to be named Kaustubh Super Bazaar - with &quot;Kaustubh&quot; being the name of one of their family members. But after surveys and discussions, it was finalised to be Kaustubh Mart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to respect their feelings behind the name. So we took the liberty to research into the name and found out its mythological significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Mystic. Lotus Inspired.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaustubh is the name given to a ratna (gem) that emerged from the mythological tale of Samudramanthan which is adorned by Lord Vishnu. Even so, there is no description of this ratna and since it emerged from the eternal sea, some intellectuals depict it as the lotus that Vishnu always holds in his hand and so we took this as an opportunity to make the logo lotus inspired. Coincedentally, K also stands for Kamal - which literally means lotus in Sanskrit.&lt;/p&gt;

They recently moved to a larger location with better infrastructure and more seating capacity. This new space is designed to be a perfect hangout place for both young and old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this perfect spot is located on a street out of the market and with lesser footfall. As a resultant, they realised a drop in their walk-ins while their online and delivery orders had remained stable.The plush comfortable place needed a playful inviting buzz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Playful. Inviting. Comfortable.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brief was simplified to these three words. Graphic designs for inhouse uses such as placemats, coasters and environmental posters were created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created a copy &quot;The Hot Burger - This Winter Offer&quot; for their ongoing offers and aligned them with the brief.
This copy also attempts to resolve the question of stone cold food deliveries during the winter season. It invites customers to relish on hot food while enjoying the cozy and comfortable space the campaign promotes.&lt;/p&gt;
