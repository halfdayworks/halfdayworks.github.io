    <p>Kaustubh Mart was a perfect assignment for us since it had to be started from scratch. While the entreprenuer client had a few guidelines for us, we were given the liberty to be our creative self. Initially, the new venture was to be named Kaustubh Super Bazaar - with "Kaustubh" being the name of one of their family members. But after surveys and discussions, it was finalised to be Kaustubh Mart.</p>

<p>We wanted to respect their feelings behind the name. So we took the liberty to research into the name and found out its mythological significance.</p>

<blockquote class="quote">"Mystic. Lotus Inspired."</blockquote>
<p>Kaustubh is the name given to a ratna (gem) that emerged from the mythological tale of Samudramanthan which is adorned by Lord Vishnu. Even so, there is no description of this ratna and since it emerged from the eternal sea, some intellectuals depict it as the lotus that Vishnu always holds in his hand and so we took this as an opportunity to make the logo lotus inspired. Coincedentally, K also stands for Kamal - which literally means lotus in Sanskrit.</p>
