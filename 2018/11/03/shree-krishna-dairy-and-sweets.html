    <p>Shree Krishna Dairy and Sweets is a famous name in its city. It is a premier dairy and traditional Indian sweets producer serving locals since 1999. It aspires to become a brand now and is preparing itself for a larger market. And so, they wanted to update their identity to recent times and wanted a logo that makes them unique and recognisable, that is proud of its heritage and keep to its roots.</p>

<blockquote class="quote">"English and Devnagari."</blockquote>

<p>We designed a logo with both english and marathi languages that aligned with the state regulations and also helped in marketing focusing on local population which is largely marathi-speaking.</p>

<p>With their aim to become a brand, they wanted to explore packaging designs for their dairy products that stood out in a highly competetive business. Along with it, updating their sweet box designs became a necessity.</p>

<blockquote class="quote">"Fresh. Clean. Distintive."</blockquote>
